# Mind the gap: Towards a magnetic palaeo-environment proxy through an extensive full micromagnetic correlation of magnetosome chain morphology and hysteresis parameters

Magnetotactic bacteria (MTB) preserved in sediments (magnetofossils) are highly sensitive to environmental and climatic forcing and may therefore be used as an easy-to-measure palaeo-environment proxy. It is known that magnetofossils occur with various different morphologies -- each with its own particular rock magnetic signature. We present the first systematic extensive micromagnetic study relating magnetosome chain morphology to their hysteresis parameters. We modelled more than 450 different intact magnetosome chains in the micromagnetic modelling software MERRILL, relating the morphology (magnetosome size, elongation, intra-chain spacing, and chain length) to the magnetic parameters of coercivity, coercivity of remanence, and saturation magnetization, and analyzing domain-states and switching modes. It is shown that magnetic properties are far dominated by the intra-chain spacing. However, analysis of 46  published TEM images of different MTB shows a correlation between intra-chain spacing and grain size. This correlation can in principle be used to infer MTB morphology purely from magnetic measurements, providing a framework to use MTB as a magnetic palaeo-environment proxy. Additionally, it is found that MTB carefully control intra-chain spacing during magnetosome synthesis to maximize saturation remanence as well as magnetic stability.
